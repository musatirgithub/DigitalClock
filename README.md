<h3>Hi there âœ‹. In this project, I've created a digital clock. For this purpose;</h3>
<ul>
  <li>First I've placed a wrist watch image as background,</li>
  <li>Then in JavaScript file I've created a new Date,</li>
  <li>Received hour, minute, second, day and month from the date,</li>
  <li>By using setInterval function I've retrieved data in every second,</li>
  <li>With the help of CSS, placed values onto wristwatch image.</li>
  <li>Casio F91W is the most sold wristwatch and after 30 years of manifacturing the Casio company still produces 3 million watches every year.</li>
  <li>I'd bought my first F-91w in 1993 when I'd started military academy. Project was simple but the memories the project reminded to me were priceless!</li>
  <li>Image of the project is below ðŸ‘‡. Hope you like the project! </li>
</ul>
